PropolisFramework - A serverless website framework
=================
Hit the grown running with no server management, no upfront provisioning, ready to scale, and pay-per-usage

## Serverless?
It abstracts away the complexity associated with managing servers.

You only need to provide your code and data to a serverless service like Google Cloud Serverless and AWS Lambda.

Avoid management of servers that demand repetitive and error-rone tasks (e.g.: scaling, OS security patches, OS package management, etc).

These serverless services only charge you for what you use. Since the provisioning and automatic scaling are dynamic.

All these benefits mean rapid time-to-market. 

## Why Serverless with PropolisFramework?
When building an online web service, web application, or website you often need to include these basic parts: authentication, templates, payment, user management, rating/review, etc.

Many OpenSource frameworks out there offer these parts but sometimes they are no exactly what we are looking for.

PropolisFramework is serverless/microservice web service/application framework. This means that you each part is his own microservice that runs in its own serverless environment.

The benefit with PropolisFramework versus other OpenSource frameworks are as follows:

- Easy to setup on serverless environments (it's made for it)
- You could as easily setup PropolisFramework in a Docker environment
- Built with Node.js (JavaScript) simple, popular, and very well supported programming language
- Small code based, so very quickly a developer can read the code and find out what that microservice is doing
- You can choose what you want to keep or not compared to many heavy monolith frameworks
- You can easily fork on GitHub one of the many microservices and modify its small code based to fit your needs
- It also comes with Terraform coded serverless environment so you as a developer just need to run the Terraform code and get a full PropolisFramework enviroment running in very short time
